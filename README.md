Tileset (png) and Tilemap (csv) files must be included in the same folder as the main exe file.

### Editor controls:
* Click tiles right of map to select
* Click to place individual tiles or click and drag to "paint" multiple into the area.
* Use the arrow keys to scroll the tilemap.
* Hold Shift to enable fast scrolling.
* Press 1 through 4 to select and edit different layers.
* Press F1 through F4 to activate and deactivate layers.
* Press escape to exit.

### Outside the editor:
* Follow the instructions in the command-line to set up and save your tilemaps.

### Notes:
* If the tilemap (csv) and tileset (png) files are in the same folder as the Tilemap Editor.exe, simply use file-name.ext.
* If they are in a folder within the exe's folder, use folder-name\file-name.ext.
* Otherwise, you must use C:\full\path\to\file-name.ext.
* The file loader I'm using doesn't like spaces in filenames. Sorry.
* UI Text and UI Text 2 are required or you'll end up with unhelpful white boxes everywhere.
